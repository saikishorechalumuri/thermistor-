# thermistor-
Code for embedded system implementing the multi-access-point   *                  thermometer by using the STM32L432 Nucleo-32 board.This   *                  multi-access point thermometer can be used in hospitals to   *                  monitor patientsâ€™temperatures from different location.This   *                  embedded software determines the temperature of patient using   *                  Mcp9700 thermistor and converted it in to degree Celsius by   *                  using the voltagetotempconv functionThe temperature values are displayed on   *                  OLED ssd1331  and putty. The RGB led light indicates different   *                  colors when the temperature are in different region. When the   *                  temperature is not in the desired region an appropriate message   *                  is shown in the putty screen.
